<p>I was reminded of this project while talking about JSON-LD with someone, and after digging this up I saw the form and spreadsheet did not work. I went ahead and fixed what was wrong with Tabletop.js, but the beautify still isn't working on the form.</p>
<p>I will be pushing this approach forward by also saving data from the spreadsheet as YAML in the local project. All my tools are available at <a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist-tools" target="_blank">API Evangelist tools</a>.</p>
