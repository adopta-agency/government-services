<h1>Department of Education Open Data And APIs</h1>
<p>I am working on a variety of projects in federal government. To support all my work, I setup an organization for each group I work with, as a Github project, then I proceed to setup each project underneath this organizational umbrella as individual project repos.</p>

<p>This is my project repository for any work I'm doing around Department of Education open data and APIs. Currently I have one project that I've pushed out the door:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
    <li><a href="http://ed-data.github.io/fafsa-api/" target="_blank">Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) API</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I will be putting any of the projects that I do for the Department of Education here. As I do with my other projects I will add blog entries to tell the story of the work.</p>

<p>This is a work in progress, meant to understand how to best work with Department of Education data and APIs, if you have feedback leave comments below.</p>
